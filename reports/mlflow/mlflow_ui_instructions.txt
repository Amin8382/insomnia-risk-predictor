              MLFLOW UI INSTRUCTIONS
============================================================

1. START MLFLOW UI:
   -----------------
   Method 1 - From Python:
      python code/04_mlflow_tracking.py --start-ui
   
   Method 2 - Command Line:
      mlflow ui --port 5000 --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db
   
   Method 3 - Using this script:
      from 04_mlflow_tracking import MLflowManager
      manager = MLflowManager()
      manager.start_mlflow_ui()

2. ACCESS THE UI:
   ----------------
   * Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:5000
   * Default port is 5000, change with --port if needed

3. UI NAVIGATION:
   ---------------
   * EXPERIMENTS: View all experiments in the left sidebar
   * RUNS: Click on experiment to see all runs
   * METRICS: Compare metrics across runs with parallel coordinates
   * PARAMETERS: View and compare hyperparameters
   * ARTIFACTS: Download models, plots, and other artifacts
   * REGISTRY: Manage registered models (Models tab)

4. KEY FEATURES:
   --------------
   * Compare runs: Select runs and click "Compare"
   * Search runs: Use search bar to filter runs
   * Download artifacts: Click on artifact to download
   * Register models: Promote best runs to Model Registry
   * Share results: Export runs as CSV or share experiment link

5. TROUBLESHOOTING:
   -----------------
   * Port in use: Try different port: mlflow ui --port 5001
   * DB locked: Close other MLflow instances
   * No runs: Check backend-store-uri matches your mlflow.db location

6. USEFUL COMMANDS:
   -----------------
   * List experiments: mlflow experiments list
   * Delete experiment: mlflow experiments delete --experiment-id <ID>
   * Download artifacts: mlflow artifacts download --run-id <ID>
   * Serve model: mlflow models serve -m runs:/<RUN_ID>/model -p 1234

7. MODEL SERVING:
   ---------------
   Once you have a registered model, serve it with:
      mlflow models serve -m "models:/insomnia_best_model/Production" -p 1234
   
   Test with:
      curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
           -d "{"data": [<your_features>]}" ^
